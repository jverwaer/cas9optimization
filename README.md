# cas9optimization

cas9optimization is Python package (single module, pure Python) that can be used perform codon optimization. The coding domain of a protein is optimized such that the frequency distribution of the codon pairs matches that of the distribution that is observed in highly expressed coding domains of the target organism.

Even though the package is generic, it was designed to codon-optimize the CAS9 coding domain.
